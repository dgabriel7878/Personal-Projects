# Backtested Trading Bot

Goal: find a trading strategy that actually holds up under backtesting
before risking any money, then move it through paper trading and finally a
live account. This repo is **Phase 1**: a framework to backtest and
objectively compare multiple strategies across stocks, futures, and crypto,
on both swing (daily) and intraday timeframes.

**Nothing in this repo places real trades yet.** It only backtests.

## How it fits together

```
trading_bot/
  config.py              # ticker universe, timeframes, cash/commission defaults
  data/loader.py          # OHLCV fetch (yfinance) + on-disk parquet cache
  strategies/              # one file per strategy, registered in __init__.py
  backtest/
    runner.py             # runs every strategy x every ticker, collects stats
    metrics.py            # extracts a clean stats row from a backtest run
scripts/
  run_backtests.py         # CLI: run everything, print + save a ranked comparison
results/                    # CSV output lands here (gitignored)
```

Backtests run on [backtesting.py](https://kernc.github.io/backtesting.py/),
a vectorized/event-driven engine that produces standard stats (Sharpe,
Sortino, max drawdown, win rate, profit factor, SQN, etc.) per run.

## Strategies included

| Strategy | Type | Timeframe | Idea |
|---|---|---|---|
| SMA Crossover | Trend-following | Daily | Fast SMA(20) crosses slow SMA(50) |
| RSI Mean Reversion | Mean reversion | Daily | Buy RSI(14) < 30, exit RSI > 55 |
| Bollinger Mean Reversion | Mean reversion | Daily | Buy at lower band, exit at the mean |
| MACD Momentum | Momentum | Daily | MACD line crosses its signal line |
| Donchian Breakout | Trend-following (Turtle-style) | Daily | Buy a 20-day high, exit a 10-day low |
| Opening Range Breakout | Breakout | Intraday (5m) | Buy a break above the first 15 minutes' range, flatten by session close |
| SMA200 Trend Filter | Trend-following (regime filter) | Daily | Long only while price is above its 200-day average |
| RSI(2) Connors Mean Reversion | Mean reversion | Daily | Buy RSI(2) < 10 only while above the 200-day average, exit RSI(2) > 70 |
| Supertrend | Trend-following (volatility-adaptive) | Daily | Long while the ATR-based Supertrend line signals an uptrend |
| Stochastic Oscillator | Mean reversion | Daily | Buy %K crossing above %D from oversold, exit the reverse from overbought |

These are well-known, widely documented approaches -- not proprietary
alpha. The point of this phase is to measure, with real cost assumptions
(commission/slippage baked into every run), whether any of them actually
produces a positive, risk-adjusted edge on the markets you care about, and
to compare them on equal footing rather than picking one on vibes.

## Asset universe

Configured in `trading_bot/config.py`. yfinance ticker conventions:

- **Stocks/ETFs**: plain symbols (`AAPL`, `SPY`, `QQQ`)
- **Futures**: continuous contracts (`ES=F`, `CL=F`, `GC=F`)
- **Crypto**: pair symbols (`BTC-USD`, `ETH-USD`)

Daily strategies pull 5 years of daily bars; intraday strategies pull 60
days of 5-minute bars (yfinance's intraday history limit).

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running backtests

```bash
# Everything: all asset classes, both timeframes
python scripts/run_backtests.py

# Narrow it down
python scripts/run_backtests.py --asset-classes stocks crypto
python scripts/run_backtests.py --timeframes daily
python scripts/run_backtests.py --cash 25000 --commission 0.0005
```

This prints a per-run results table (one row per strategy x ticker) and a
ranked summary (strategies sorted by average Sharpe Ratio across every
market tested), and saves both as timestamped CSVs under `results/`.

## Validating a strategy out-of-sample

A backtest over one fixed history can look great purely because its
parameters were (unintentionally) tuned to that exact history. Before
trusting a strategy from the ranking above, walk-forward validate it: the
tool below optimizes its parameters on the first `--train-frac` of each
ticker's history, then runs those exact parameters, unmodified, on the
remaining unseen period.

```bash
python scripts/validate_strategy.py --strategy "Donchian Breakout" --tickers AAPL SPY QQQ GC=F
python scripts/validate_strategy.py --strategy "RSI Mean Reversion" --train-frac 0.6
```

Only strategies with a parameter grid registered in
`trading_bot/backtest/validate.py`'s `PARAM_GRIDS` can be validated this
way (currently all six). If most tickers keep a positive out-of-sample
Sharpe with their in-sample-optimized parameters, that's real evidence of
an edge. If most go negative or flip sign, the in-sample backtest was
likely curve-fit, not a tradable edge.

## Interpreting the output

Don't just chase total return. Look at, in rough order of importance:

- **Sharpe / Sortino Ratio** -- return per unit of risk; the primary
  ranking metric. Below ~0.5-1.0 on a multi-year backtest generally isn't
  worth trading.
- **Max Drawdown** -- the worst peak-to-trough loss. A strategy with a
  great return but a 50% drawdown is not survivable emotionally or
  financially.
- **Win Rate** and **Profit Factor** -- a strategy can be profitable with
  a low win rate if winners are much bigger than losers (trend-following),
  or need a high win rate if it's a mean-reversion strategy with small
  edges.
- **# Trades** -- too few trades (e.g. under ~30) means the stats aren't
  statistically meaningful; too many relative to the period can mean
  commissions are eating the edge.
- Compare **Return [%] vs. Buy & Hold Return [%]** -- a strategy that
  can't beat buying and holding the same asset isn't adding value.

A strategy that looks great on one ticker but falls apart on the others
tested is probably overfit to that ticker's specific history, not a real
edge.

## Adding a new strategy

1. Create `trading_bot/strategies/my_strategy.py` with a class subclassing
   `backtesting.Strategy` (see any existing strategy for the pattern).
2. Register it in `trading_bot/strategies/__init__.py`'s
   `STRATEGY_REGISTRY`, tagged `"daily"` or `"intraday"`.
3. Run `python scripts/run_backtests.py` -- it's automatically included in
   the comparison.

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1 (this repo, in progress)**: backtest and rank strategies
  across markets; iterate on parameters until one shows a consistent,
  robust edge net of costs (not just a lucky curve-fit on one ticker/date
  range).
- **Phase 2**: wire the winning strategy into a live-data loop against an
  **Alpaca paper trading account** (free, real-time fills, zero real
  money at risk) via their REST/websocket API, and run it for a
  meaningful sample period before trusting it.
- **Phase 3**: once the paper account confirms the edge survives real
  execution (slippage, fills, latency, live data quirks), move a small
  amount of real capital, with strict position sizing and a kill switch.

**Disclaimer**: a strategy that backtests well is not a guarantee of
future performance -- markets change, and backtests are prone to overfitting
and survivorship bias. Treat every "proven" result here as a hypothesis to
keep testing, not a fact. Only risk money you can afford to lose, and size
up gradually even after a successful paper-trading run.
